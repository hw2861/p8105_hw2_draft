## Question1

In the first step, i import and clean the NYC_Transit_data.

``` r
NYC_Transit =read_csv("./hw2_downloadfile/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv") %>% 
  janitor:: clean_names() %>% 
  select(line,station_name,station_latitude,station_longitude,route1:route11,entry,vending,entrance_type,ada) %>%
  mutate(entry=recode(entry, "YES"=TRUE , "NO" = FALSE))
```

    ## Rows: 1868 Columns: 32
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (22): Division, Line, Station Name, Route1, Route2, Route3, Route4, Rout...
    ## dbl  (8): Station Latitude, Station Longitude, Route8, Route9, Route10, Rout...
    ## lgl  (2): ADA, Free Crossover

The dataset contains information about each entrance and exit for each
subway station in NYC. In the original dataset,there are 32 variables
regarding the subway station. I cleaned the dataset by retaining my
variables of interests.A part of the variable on geographical location
has been removed. In the new dataset, It contains the variables as
subway lines, station name, the latitude and longitude of the
station,routes served,entry, vending,entrance type, and ADA compliance.
In the meantime, I standardised the names of the remaining 19 variables.
And the data of the entry variable has been recoded from a character(YES
vs NO) to a logical variable with “TRUE” or “FALSE”. For the dimension,
There are 1868 rows × 19 columns. These data are not tidy currently.
Because there are redundant columns for route numbers.And the route
numbers across 11 columns can be organised into 1 columns.
